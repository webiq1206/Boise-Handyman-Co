/**
 * GENERATED FILE - do not edit by hand.
 *
 * Source: two owner-supplied workbooks, cross-checked against each other:
 *   - "Record - Timber and Love - Master Estimate Buildertrend Import Template - v1.xlsx"
 *   - "Report - Timber and Love - Cost Estimates Schedule - v2.csv.xlsx"
 * Every cost agreed exactly between the two files (0 discrepancies across 209 codes).
 *
 * These are COST figures and carry NO margin. Margin is applied by the pricing
 * engine as a true gross margin (cost / (1 - GM)), never as a markup. See
 * shared/costs/pricing.ts.
 *
 * Two cost codes present in the schedule are DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED here:
 *   F-01-02  Phase 1 + 2 Design-Build Fees   25%
 *   F-03-00  Phase 3 Design-Build Fees       25%
 * Those are the source firm's own fee structure. Boise Handyman Co applies its
 * own gross-margin target instead, so carrying both would double-count margin.
 *
 * Two source rows carry a BLANK unit-of-measure cell. They are defaulted to EA
 * and marked inline. Neither is referenced by any scope rule, so the default
 * never reaches a price; it exists so the catalog stays type-safe and complete.
 *
 * The 27 zero-cost "Other ..." rows ARE retained. They are per-division
 * catch-alls with no rate, used by an estimator to add custom scope by hand.
 * The automatic scope builder never selects them; they exist so the catalog is a
 * faithful copy of the source and so admin tooling can offer them.
