 * construction, so every lead the public estimator produced failed validation
 * and 400ed. Both were also missing the six new-construction refinements
 * (garage, basement, lot services, site difficulty, covered outdoor, shop
 * size), and because Zod strips unknown keys rather than rejecting them, that
 * failure was silent: the server would have recomputed the price without the
 * garage or the well and septic and quoted a different number than the visitor
 * was shown.
 *
 * The exhaustiveness checks below are the actual protection. Adding a member to
