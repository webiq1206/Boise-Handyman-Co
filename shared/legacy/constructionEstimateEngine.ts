   TYPICAL SELECTIONS ("project profiles")

   The estimator should behave like a project manager, not a form. A PM does
   not ask a homeowner how many linear feet of cabinet they have; they look at
   an L-shaped kitchen at a mid-range finish and know what that usually means.

   So the finish level carries a profile of what it typically includes, and the
   estimator pre-selects it rather than asking. Two rules keep this honest and
   distinguish it from the hidden inference removed elsewhere in this engine:

     1. Every pre-selected value is SHOWN to the homeowner, not buried.
     2. Every one of them is editable.

   The line is what a homeowner actually knows. They know their project type,
   roughly how big it is, how many bathrooms they have, and how nice they want
   it. They do not know whether their cabinetry is "semi-custom", or whether
   their plumbing counts as "relocated". Asking the second kind adds friction
   without adding accuracy, because the answer is a guess either way.

 * reference sizes match `PROJECT_SIZE_CONFIG` baselines exactly (kitchen 250,
 * bathroom 80, whole-home 1,800, addition 400, ADU 600, basement 900), so each
 * cell here is the guide's per-square-foot range multiplied by that size.
 *
 * The guide's kitchen high-end cell is internally inconsistent: it lists
 * $400-$650/sf but a total of $100,000-$137,500, and $137,500 implies $550/sf.
 * The per-square-foot figure is used, because the guide's stated unit is per
 * square foot and $650 sits flush against the $700 luxury floor (a $550 cap
 * would leave a gap between the tiers). Change `high` on kitchen high-end to
 * 137500 if the dollar figure was the intended one.
 *
 * The guide quotes kitchens "no wall movement" and bathrooms "no layout
 * change", which is why these are pure baselines: layout, systems, and
 * cabinetry choices are applied on top as multipliers rather than baked in.
 *
 * Note that a per-square-foot rate holds only at the reference size. Cost is
 * scaled sublinearly from here (see SIZE_ELASTICITY), so a larger kitchen has a
 * lower effective rate per square foot, which is how remodel cost actually
 * behaves and is consistent with the guide's own rates falling as project size
 * rises across categories.

   * and luxury [175000, 225000].
   *
   * Evidence. EST-10088 billed $34,335 and EST-10049 billed $31,850 for its
   * kitchen. Neither is directly comparable, because both carry a narrower
   * scope than this catalog's kitchen: EST-10088 has no flooring and no
   * backsplash, EST-10049 has no flooring, demolition, drywall or paint in the
   * kitchen line. Normalizing each to the full component scope in
   * costCatalog.ts (by the share of direct work it actually covers, and
   * removing the client-supplied appliances EST-10049 lists) puts a
   * full-scope, mid-range equivalent at about $35,250 and $46,330 against a
   * model that quoted $49,500. That is 0.71x and 0.94x.
   *
   * The two disagree, so 0.85 is deliberately the conservative middle rather
   * than the lower reading. Cutting to 0.71 would match EST-10088 but would
   * under-quote a genuinely full-scope kitchen, which is the more expensive
   * mistake: the floor is what a homeowner holds you to. One more closed
   * kitchen with its square footage recorded settles this properly.

   * baseline is assumed rather than measured. See ESTIMATOR-CALIBRATION.md.

 * What the whole-home rate already assumes.
 *
 * A whole-home price is not uniform per square foot: kitchens and bathrooms
 * cost several times what general living space does. The published rate must
 * therefore assume some number of each, and that number is solvable rather than
 * a matter of opinion, because the same guide prices kitchens and bathrooms on
 * their own. Subtracting a kitchen and N baths from the whole-home figure
 * leaves a residual that must be a believable rate for flooring, paint, trim,
 * doors and lighting:
 *
 *   assumed baths     refresh   mid-range   high-end   luxury
 *   1                    $17       $51        $78       $171   per sq ft
 *   2                     $8       $37        $52       $128
 *   3                    -$1       $22        $22        $79
 *
 * Three baths is impossible: it makes refresh negative. One bath implies $51/sf
 * for paint and flooring, more than a bathroom costs per foot. Two is the only
 * count that stays believable at every finish level, and 1,800 sq ft with one
 * kitchen and two baths is the standard Treasure Valley three-bed home.
 *
 * STALE AS OF 2026-07 - the table above no longer reconciles. Whole-home was
 * raised by 4/3 (owner pricing decision) and kitchen was cut to 0.85 (calibrated
 * against two issued estimates), while the bathroom rate did not move. Re-running
 * the same arithmetic on the current numbers leaves $75/sq ft of residual at two
 * baths, where the original solve accepted $37 and rejected $51 as impossible.
 *
 * The count is deliberately LEFT AT 2 rather than re-solved. Re-solving would
 * push it to about 4, and because this is the figure the stated-bathroom-count
 * adjustment measures FROM, raising it would quietly discount every home with
 * fewer than four baths and cancel out the increase that was just applied.
 *
 * The honest reading is that the residual test itself is too crude now: it
 * treats everything that is not a kitchen or a bath as "flooring, paint and
 * trim", when whole-home scope also carries HVAC, windows, electrical and
 * plumbing. Settling this properly needs a closed whole-home job with its
 * square footage and bathroom count, not more arithmetic on published rates.

 * it scales too. Holding the reference at a flat 2 makes the adjustment measure
 * from the wrong place at every size except the baseline.
 *
 * Solved the same way as the baseline count. Subtract a kitchen and N baths
 * from the whole-home figure and read the residual left for general living
 * space, which should stay roughly constant across house sizes because
 * flooring, paint and trim do not get cheaper per foot as a house grows. At
 * mid-range the 1,800 sq ft reference leaves $39/sq ft with 2 baths, and that

 *
 *   1,800 sq ft -> 2 baths      5,000 sq ft -> 5 baths
