 * Empty until real, photographed homes exist for Boise Handyman Co.

 * The previous entries were placeholder remodeling projects carrying specific
 * factual claims ("a 1990s Eagle home", "600 sq ft master suite addition").
 * Presenting those as this builder's portfolio would describe work that was
 * never performed, so they are retired rather than relabelled.
 *
 * The before/after shape also does not survive the move to new construction:
 * there is no "before" for a house that did not exist. A rebuilt portfolio
 * should use finished-home photography or clearly labelled concept renderings,
 * which will need a different interface than GalleryProject.
 *
 * Every consumer guards on an empty list, so gallery sections and area-page
 * proof blocks render nothing while this stays empty.
