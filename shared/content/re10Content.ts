export const RE10_FAQS: Re10Faq[] = [
  {
    question: "What is an RE-10 repair request?",
    answer:
      "An RE-10 is the Idaho inspection response form. After a home inspection, the buyer uses it to request specific repairs before closing, and the seller agrees, declines or negotiates. The agreed items become the repair list that has to be completed and documented before the transaction closes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you review the full RE-10 document?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Send the RE-10 and the relevant inspection report pages and we will work through every requested item, tell you which we can price from the documents, which need a photo or a measurement, and which need an onsite evaluation before anyone should put a number on them.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work directly with the real estate agent?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Agents are who we usually deal with. We can take the documents from you, coordinate access with the buyer, seller or occupant, and send you the scope, pricing and completion documentation directly so you can pass it on.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle multiple repairs at the same property?",
    answer:
      "Yes, and it is the efficient way to do it. Most RE-10 lists span several trades. We group the work so travel and set-up are shared across the list rather than charged separately for every item, which is usually cheaper than hiring each trade individually.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can you review a repair request?",
    answer:
      "Most repair lists are reviewed within one business day of receiving the documents. Send them as early as you can. The earlier we see the list, the more honestly we can tell you what fits inside your deadline.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you complete repairs before closing?",
    answer:
      "Often, but we will not promise it before seeing the list. It depends on the scope, material lead times, property access and how much of the calendar is left. We prioritize transaction-related repairs and will tell you clearly what can reasonably be finished inside your timeframe.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide written estimates?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every repair list gets a written scope with pricing, the assumptions behind it, and what is excluded. Anything that needs an onsite evaluation is listed separately rather than guessed at.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide completion photos, invoices and receipts?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Completed work is documented with photos, and you get itemized invoices and receipts where applicable, in a form you can forward to the other agent, the lender or your client without reformatting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work on vacant properties and coordinate lockbox access?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Vacant, occupied and tenant-occupied properties are all routine. We confirm the access arrangement in writing before the first visit, including lockbox codes or key handling, and we do not turn up unannounced.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if you find additional damage?",
    answer:
      "Work stops on that item and you hear about it the same day, with photos. Nothing additional is completed until whoever holds authority approves it in writing. Concealed damage behind a finish is the commonest reason an inspection repair changes price.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle plumbing and electrical repairs?",
    answer:
      "We handle minor plumbing and electrical repairs of the kind that appear on inspection responses: faucets, supply valves, toilets, leaks, outlets, switches, GFCI protection, light fixtures and detectors. Main electrical service, panel work, gas lines, and sewer or septic require a licensed specialist and we will point you to one.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is responsible for approving additional work?",
    answer:
      "Whoever is paying for it. We ask at the start of the job who holds approval authority, usually the seller or the buyer depending on the agreement, and we take written approval from that person before any work beyond the agreed scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with repairs before a property is listed?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Pre-listing repairs, deferred maintenance, safety corrections and cosmetic work before photography or showings are all work we do. Handling likely inspection items before listing usually costs less than negotiating them after an inspection.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do all repairs require an onsite inspection?",
    answer:
      "No. Many common items can be scoped and priced from a clear repair request and a photo. Anything structural, anything involving water intrusion, mold or concealed damage, and anything where the request is too vague to price responsibly needs someone on site first.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you guarantee a repair will satisfy the buyer or the inspector?",
    answer:
      "No, and no contractor honestly can. We complete the repair correctly and document it, but whether a re-inspection or a buyer accepts it is their decision. What we can do is make sure the work is done properly and that the documentation shows exactly what was completed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work throughout the Treasure Valley?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Boise, Meridian, Eagle, Nampa, Kuna, Star, Middleton, Garden City and Caldwell, across Ada and Canyon County.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I submit an RE-10 or inspection report?",
    answer:
      "Send it through the form on this page with the property address, repair deadline and closing date, or call or text us and we will tell you where to send it. PDFs, scans and phone photos of a printed document all work.",
