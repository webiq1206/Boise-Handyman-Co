# Backlink Engine - boisehandyman.co

An autonomous backlink **intelligence** system with **human-approved outreach**. It discovers,
qualifies, scores, prioritizes, monitors, and drafts on a schedule with no human involvement - and
keeps a human on the irreversible send/submit/pay step. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the design and the
rationale for that boundary.

> **REBRAND NOTICE (2026-08):** configs and templates now target **Boise Handyman Co /
> boisehandyman.co**, but everything under `data/` and `outreach/queue.json` +
> `outreach/citations/` is **stale generated output from the old Boise Remodeling profile**.
> Regenerate with `npm run backlink:run -- --dry-run` before acting on any draft or packet, and
> do **not** enable sends until boisehandyman.co has SPF, DKIM and DMARC verified in Resend
> (see `EMAIL_DELIVERABILITY_SETUP.md` at the repo root).

## Commands
```bash
npm run backlink:preflight   # validate config + env + live Ahrefs (run before first cron)
npm run backlink:run         # full loop (needs AHREFS_API_KEY; DATABASE_URL for durability)
npm run backlink:run -- --dry-run   # offline: scoring + drafting + JSON persistence
npm run backlink:score       # re-score the current opportunity list
npm run backlink:contacts    # resolve + report outreach email addresses for P1/P2 targets
npm run backlink:send        # dry-run report of what WOULD send (never sends unless enabled)
```

## Environment
| Var | Purpose | Without it |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| `AHREFS_API_KEY` | live discovery + monitoring | those stages skip |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Neon Postgres persistence (durable across the ephemeral cron) | falls back to JSON files |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | sending approved outreach | sends unavailable (drafts still generate) |
| `BACKLINK_SEND_ENABLED` | global send kill-switch (`true` to arm) | off by default - nothing sends |
| `OUTREACH_FROM` | From address for sends | `hello@boisehandyman.co` |
| `HUNTER_API_KEY` | enhanced email discovery (optional) | site-crawl only (still finds most) |

## The autonomous loop
`npm run backlink:run` -> DISCOVER (competitor refdomains) -> QUALIFY/CLASSIFY (anti-spam gate) ->
SCORE -> MONITOR (our DR + live refdomains, new/lost detection, disavow refresh) -> DRAFT (emails +
citation packets into the queue) -> DIGEST (`data/run-log.md`). State persists in Postgres (or JSON).
Deploy it weekly via `REPLIT-CRON.md`.

### What stays human (by design)
Sending emails, submitting forms, joining paid programs, uploading the disavow file. The engine
prepares all of them to one-click readiness; a person approves. `send.mjs` only emails an item a
human set to `status:"approved"` with a valid recipient, and only when `BACKLINK_SEND_ENABLED=true`.

## To finish going live
1. `npm run backlink:preflight` on Replit (secrets set) - fix any FAIL.
2. Set `DATABASE_URL` so state is durable, and fill `config/profile.json` (sender name, long
   description, portfolio photo URLs) so drafts become send-ready.
3. Create the weekly Scheduled Deployment (see `REPLIT-CRON.md`).
4. Review `data/disavow.txt` -> upload to Search Console. Approve the P1 batch in
   `data/pipeline-report.md`. Approve/send outreach from the queue when ready.
