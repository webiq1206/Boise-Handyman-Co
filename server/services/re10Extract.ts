/**
 * Reading an RE-10 with Claude.
 *
 * WHY A PORT AND NOT A DIRECT CALL. Everything downstream - the wizard, the
 * contact gate, the estimator, the emails - depends on an ExtractionResult, not
 * on Anthropic. `extractRepairs` is the only place that knows a model exists.
 * That keeps the rest of the feature testable without a key and without a
 * network, and it means the day this is swapped or a second provider is added,
 * one file changes.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not price, it does not decide what is worth
 * reviewing beyond what the document says, and it does not fill in blanks. A
 * missing measurement stays missing; the estimator has a documented assumption
 * for that and the homeowner is told. An extractor that guesses quantities
 * would produce confident prices for work nobody requested, which is the
 * single most expensive way this feature could fail.
