/**
 * Reading an architectural plan set with Claude.
 *
 * Deliberately the same shape as re10Extract.ts, down to the error taxonomy.
 * These are two instances of one job - read a document, return a typed result,
 * never guess - and giving them different structures would mean two sets of
 * failure handling to keep correct instead of one pattern to recognise.
 *
 * WHY A PORT AND NOT A DIRECT CALL. Everything downstream depends on an
 * ExtractedPlan, not on Anthropic. This is the only file that knows a model
 * exists, so the estimator stays testable without a key and without a network.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not price and it does not fill in blanks. A plan
 * set that does not state its square footage comes back with null square
 * footage, and the estimator keeps whatever the visitor set by hand. That is the
 * whole discipline of this file: the single most expensive failure would be a
 * confident area the drawings never stated, because every other number in the
 * budget scales from it.

   * base64-encoded into the request body, which inflates them by a third, and

   * ~32 MB and can fail the API call with an opaque size error AFTER the visitor

   * about to send the model is lower, and crossing it returns the same friendly
   * "send the cover sheet and floor plans" guidance rather than a raw failure.
   *
   * A permit set that large is almost always mostly structural and detail
   * sheets, which carry no scope the budget needs; the cover sheet, site plan
   * and floor plans do, and they are a small fraction of the page count.
