# Entity Map

Complete entity inventory: organization, services, locations, team, projects.

> Note: organization identity below is kept in sync with `shared/siteConfig.ts`
> (Boise Handyman Co, boisehandyman.co). The service, location, and
> project tables were captured during the original remodeling-site audit and
> predate the new-construction rebuild, so treat them as historical.

## Service entities (5)

| Service | Slug | Pillar guide | Cluster posts | City pages | Reviews | Projects |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kitchen Remodel | kitchen-remodel | boise-kitchen-remodeling-guide | 8 | 8 | 1 (Boise) | 1 (Boise) |
| Bathroom Remodel | bathroom-remodel | boise-bathroom-remodeling-guide | 7 | 8 | 1 (Meridian) | 1 (Meridian) |
| Whole-Home Remodel | whole-home-remodel | whole-home-remodeling-guide | 7 | 8 | 1 (Eagle) | 1 (Eagle) |
| Room Addition | room-addition | boise-home-addition-guide | 8 | 8 | 1 (Nampa) | 1 (Nampa) |
| ADU / Guest House | adu | (covered in additions/home guides) | — | 8 | 0 | 0 |

**Gaps:** ADU has no dedicated pillar guide and no proof. Basement-finish appears in `GALLERY_PROJECTS` but has no service page (orphan project type).

## Location entities (8)

| City | County | Area page | Location guide | Neighborhoods (data) | Reviews | Projects |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Boise | Ada | yes | yes | 5 | 1 | 2 |
| Meridian | Ada | yes | yes | 4 | 1 | 1 |
| Eagle | Ada | yes | yes | 4 | 1 | 1 |
| Kuna | Ada | yes | yes | 4 | 0 | 0 |
| Star | Ada | yes | yes | 4 | 0 | 0 |
| Nampa | Canyon | yes | yes | 4 | 1 | 1 |
| Middleton | Canyon | yes | yes | 4 | 0 | 0 |
| Caldwell | Canyon | yes | **was MISSING → added** | 4 | 0 | 0 |

All cities have rich `CITY_SEO_DATA` (population, zips, neighborhoods, landmarks, climate, coordinates) in `lib/seo.ts` — but before this pass only the first neighborhood was used on city×service pages. Now full data is surfaced.

## Team / People entities — MAJOR GAP

- **No named people anywhere.** No founder, owner, project managers, designers, or installers in content or schema.
- Blog/guide author is always the string "Boise Remodeling Co".
- About page uses a generic leadership photo with no names/titles/bios.
- **Impact:** This is the dominant E-E-A-T weakness. Competitors name owners (e.g. "Chad and Shelley," "John and Theresa").
- **Action:** Person-entity plumbing wired (Article author → Person → `/about#team`); **actual names/bios are data-gated.**

## Project entities (5 gallery + 4 testimonials)

- City + service tagged, which enables embedding on matching landing pages (now wired).
- **Gaps:** Only 4 of 8 cities represented; descriptions are short and lack neighborhood/permit specifics; no dates; basement-finish project has no destination service page.

## Entity confusion risks

- **`@id` collision:** every per-city `LocalBusiness` uses `@id: baseUrl`, so 8 city pages + homepage + contact assert different coordinates under one entity ID. Fixed via stable `@id` strategy (see [schema-map.md](schema-map.md)).
- **NAP inconsistency:** schema uses the Kuna street address; footer says "Boise, Idaho." Recommend aligning on one canonical NAP.
