# Email Deliverability Setup Guide for Boise Handyman Co

## Overview
This guide ensures your emails reach customers' inboxes instead of spam folders. Proper email authentication is **critical** for deliverability.

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL: DNS Authentication Required

`boisehandyman.co` is a brand-new domain that has never sent mail: **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC must be configured before any email leaves it**, transactional or outreach. Without authentication, mail from a fresh domain goes straight to spam. The `dmarc@boisehandyman.co` mailbox (or an alias to hello@) must exist to receive DMARC reports.

### What Each Protocol Does:
- **SPF**: Confirms your identity by authorizing which servers can send email from your domain
- **DKIM**: Ensures emails aren't tampered with during transmission (adds digital signature)
- **DMARC**: Leverages both SPF and DKIM, tells receiving servers what to do with unauthenticated emails

---

## Step 1: Configure Resend DNS Records

### 1.1 Access Your DNS Provider
Log into your domain registrar or DNS provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.) for `boisehandyman.co`.

### 1.2 Add DKIM Records
Resend provides DKIM automatically. You need to add these DNS records:

**Get your DKIM records from Resend:**
1. Log into [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Select your domain `boisehandyman.co`
3. Copy the DKIM DNS records provided (usually 3 CNAME records)

**Example DKIM records (yours will be different):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: resend._domainkey.boisehandyman.co.at.resend.com
TTL: 3600

Type: CNAME
Name: resend2._domainkey
Value: resend2._domainkey.boisehandyman.co.at.resend.com
TTL: 3600

Type: CNAME
Name: resend3._domainkey
Value: resend3._domainkey.boisehandyman.co.at.resend.com
TTL: 3600
```

### 1.3 Add SPF Record
Add or update your SPF record to authorize Resend to send emails on your behalf.

**If you already have an SPF record:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com include:_spf.resend.com ~all
TTL: 3600
```

**If you don't have an SPF record:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
TTL: 3600
```

⚠️ **Important**: Only ONE SPF record allowed per domain! If you have existing SPF, append `include:_spf.resend.com` to it.

### 1.4 Add DMARC Record
DMARC tells email providers what to do with unauthenticated emails.

**Start with monitoring mode (p=none):**
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@boisehandyman.co; ruf=mailto:dmarc@boisehandyman.co; fo=1; adkim=s; aspf=s
TTL: 3600
```

**After 2-4 weeks of monitoring, upgrade to quarantine:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@boisehandyman.co; ruf=mailto:dmarc@boisehandyman.co; fo=1; adkim=s; aspf=s; pct=25
TTL: 3600
```

**After 2 more weeks, upgrade to reject:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@boisehandyman.co; ruf=mailto:dmarc@boisehandyman.co; fo=1; adkim=s; aspf=s; pct=100
TTL: 3600
```

## Step 2: Verify DNS Configuration

### 2.1 Check Resend Dashboard
1. Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)

- **MXToolbox DMARC Check**: https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc.aspx
- **DKIM Validator**: https://dkimvalidator.com/
- **Mail-Tester**: https://www.mail-tester.com/ (send test email, get spam score)

## Step 3: Monitor Email Deliverability

### 3.1 Google Postmaster Tools
Set up [Google Postmaster Tools](https://postmaster.google.com/) to monitor:
- Domain reputation
- IP reputation
- Spam rate
- Authentication success rate

### 3.2 Key Metrics to Track
- **Bounce rate**: Keep < 2%
- **Spam complaint rate**: Keep < 0.1%
- **Open rate**: Aim for > 20%
- **Click rate**: Aim for > 2%

## Current Status: Email Branding Unified

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Shared email layout** in `server/services/emailLayout.ts` - text-based logo matching the public site (charcoal + ochre palette)
2. **Plain-text parts** added to all Resend sends for deliverability and accessibility
3. **HTML escaping** applied to user-provided content in templates
4. **From / reply-to / admin notifications** use `hello@boisehandyman.co` (`PLATFORM_EMAIL` in `emailLayout.ts`)

### Email modules:
- `server/services/emailLayout.ts` - shared layout, branding, escaping
- `server/services/emailTransport.ts` - Resend transport (RESEND_API_KEY / Replit connector)
- `server/services/emailNotifications.ts` - lead marketplace and admin emails
- `server/services/consultationEmail.ts` - estimate + consultation emails
- `server/services/re10Email.ts` - RE-10 repair quote emails
- `server/services/complianceEmails.ts` - compliance, contract, and project emails

### Cron routes (set `CRON_SECRET` and schedule in production):
- `GET|POST /api/cron/compliance-reminders` - compliance document reminders
- `GET|POST /api/cron/lead-price-updates` - lead price reductions + watcher notifications
- `GET|POST /api/cron/admin-lead-reminders` - admin digest, pending reminders, auto-decline after 48h
